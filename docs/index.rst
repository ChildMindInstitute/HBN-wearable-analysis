The Mindboggle project includes `Software`_, `Data`_,  and `Documentation`_
intended to improve the accuracy, precision, and consistency of automated
labeling and shape analysis of human brain image data.
We promote open science by making all data, software, and documentation
freely and openly available.

Mindboggle's open source, freely available python `Software`_ automates
labeling, feature extraction, and shape analysis of human brain image data.
The `Data`_ include atlases, templates, and individual manually labeled brain
image data, the largest collection of publicly available, manually labeled
human brains in the world!

Citing Mindboggle
-----------------
We are preparing an article for publication that documents the Mindboggle
software and its application to public data to characterize human brain shape
variation and brain morphometry in Alzheimer's disease.
In the meantime, please cite this website and relevant articles at the
`Papers`_ link above, which includes the following:
